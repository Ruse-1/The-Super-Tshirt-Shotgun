WARNING: USING PRESSURIZED GAS WITH PVC IS SPECIFICALLY AGAINST MANUFACTURER SPECICFICATIONS. USE SPECIFCALLY RATED PVC FOR ANY PROJECTS SIMILAR TO THIS, IT CAN FAIL AT JOINTS AND CAUSE BODILY HARM.
(Also main reasion for use of Mcmaster, I trust them, I would like to be safe :))

A t-shirt cannon that has 2 barrels that fire tshirts, that fire at the same time.
I made this project because I haven't made my own hardware project before, and I have always wanted to do pneumatics. This seems like a great way to get started with pneumatics, and I got inspired by my Robotics' Team Tshirt Cannon. Also it's cool to say I have a Super Tshirt Shotgun.
Note: Version 1 is mainly just for archieve purposes, BOM Version 2 is the current updated BOM, any files in Version 1 are not in use.
