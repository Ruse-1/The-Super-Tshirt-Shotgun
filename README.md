# The-Super-Tshirt-Shotgun
A t-shirt cannon that has 2 barrels that fire tshirts, that operate seperately of eachother.
I made this project because I haven't really ever done my own hardware project like this, and I have been really interested in making something related to pneumatics. And also owning your own t-shirt gun is kinda cool.
