# The-Super-Tshirt-Shotgun
A t-shirt cannon that has 2 barrels that fire tshirts, that fire at the same time.
I made this project because I haven't made my own hardware project before, and I have always wanted to do pneumatics. This seems like a great way to get started with pneumatics, and I got inspired by my Robotics' Team Tshirt Cannon. Also it's cool to say I have a Super Tshirt Shotgun.
Note: Version 1 is mainly just for archieve purposes, BOM Version 2 is the current updated BOM, any files in Version 1 are not in use.
