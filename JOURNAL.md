Initial Research/Design (1.0 Hour)
Started with searching up for instructions/designs on homemade single barrel t-shirt cannons, with [this one](https://www.instructables.com/T-shirt-Cannon/) being the one I am most likely going to reference.

This is their cannon they made, I am most likely gonna have similar build methods.

Another reference I will use is [This Air cannon](https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Make-a-Coaxial-Air-Cannon/) that explains more specific steps in making the cannon.

Layout Design (2.8 Hours)
I've finished my layout design for the cannon, with the idea being there is a main Air Tank on top that leads into 2 air tanks below which lead into their own barrel. Essentially the bottom mechanism is the same as [this](https://www.instructables.com/How-To-Build-a-Generic-Air-Cannon/), just repeated twice. The hope is that I will finish cadding the full assembly soon.

Started BOM And Air Tank CAD (3.0 Hours)
I've began the BOM on Google spreadsheets and finished roughly the main tank CAD.

It's pretty rough, most of it is more or less very simple geometry to use as reference. The parts are the right sizes, and if I get around to it, I might replace it with proper models, but good enough for now. 
On the BOM, I managed to find the right brass fittings, I was making sure the threading was all correct.

Actually got Plumbing Relatively Done (2.5 Hours)
Spent like 2-3 hours trying to find the right tubing and valves for the back, it was not fun. I might still need to find smaller hoses, but for now, I have all the parts for the back plumbing done. 

I don’t really have a picture so here’s the tee brass connector I’m using.

Ok, For real Finished Plumbing I hope - (1.0 hour) Fisrt Journal
Ok So after review, I added valves for the firing tanks, found smaller hoses, and changed the plumbing. Here, there is 2 stop valves for adjustable air flow to each firing tank, and instead of a 90 degree valve going down, i realized that is completely useless and instead added 2 90 degrees on the end of the valves for more ideal connection of the hoses.

Almost complete CAD Assembly (3.5 hours) - Second Journal
<img width="830" height="461" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6cc8ef6-ffe3-4943-a019-6e1cab0418f7" />

I am close to finishing the main cad assembly of my design. My worry now is the price. My BOM is over 300$, and I have already began considering a redesign. The price is 300$ without the PVC pipe, should I redesign for a cheaper price?

Firing Mechanism CAD/Main Assem (1.0 Hours) - Third Journal
<img width="832" height="430" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f715c53-79a8-4b89-8f86-652875a51f4b" />

I finished the firing mechanism CAD of the cannon, and now all that is left is to finish the BOM, finish the assembly, refine some of the models and add the hose.

^^
ROUGH MAIN ASSEM DONE :tada
fixing the plumbing in the back with proper models (I love mcmaster carr so much), add hose, and then review bom with others.

Changes not mentioned yet today - (0.5 Hours)
First, changed length of the firing barrels. They used to be 18in, but for cost purposes, it's been reduced to 1ft each. 
<img width="828" height="225" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/687bc33a-d42f-4603-a0ef-1006de7ad6d6" />

I also need to make holders. Since quite literally nothing is holding the cannon actually together, I want to use a combination of 3D printed PETG holders, superglue, and ducttape, but I need to actually design the holders to work on my not supersized printer.

ok so about me finishing plumbing (1.5 Hours)
<img width="829" height="596" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20a56d05-27f1-4eab-a58c-78e997778f5b" />

NOW for real its actually hopefully finished. I changed the sizing of all the plumbing in the back to 1/8in NPT, and changed the Reducer Couplings for the firing mechanism from 3inx 1.5 to 3in x 2in because it was like a lot cheaper lol.
Now everything should have its proper cad model, all remaining is finish setting up my github, review and rework bom, and add a hose. And i dont know how to do 3d sketches so. yay. 

Finished Model (Minus 3D Printed Holders and Airhose)

Changes in PVC Pipe and CAD update
I changed the size of the PVC pipe of the firing airtank from 16in length to 12in in length, mainly so I could buy 4ft of PVC instead of 5. I also added "representive" air hoses, mainly for easier visualization. Some last changes are changes in the BOM from suppliers, and finishing up the Repo, but other than that, I am nearly completetion I Think.

November 19 2025 - (0.5 Hour)
New Version
Ive began a new design, mainly because after finishing the other one, I realized many ways to make it cheaper, and now, i am cutting out completely 3 airtanks, airhose, and 2 seperate triggers. I am now having one airtank that leads into a valve, with a tee fitting, and that leads to 2 barrels. This hopefully will still provide the same launch distance I will hope for while be far cheaper and hacing the dual firing that I want.

Finished Version 2 Sketch

Here is the new and improved sketch. At the back is a 12 inch long 3in PVC air tank connected to a coupler and reducer that leads into 1/2NPT plumbing, which breaks in a Tee connector down 2 2 feet 3in Barrels.
